    How do I approach designing software?
    
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

One design skill I learned working on this project is catering the design to work well with OpenGL.  OpenGL is essentially a state machine -- a design pattern I don't work with often -- so I had to learn how to work within that environment.  Some example skills include manipulating the state machine member variables and finding ways to reuse data structures.
        
        What design process did you follow for your project work?

Most boilerplate code and software architecture was provided at the onset of this project.  From there, I followed an iterative process of adding small blocks of functionality and extracting it into their own methods.
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The main tactic I can take from this project into the future is writing code that works within a framework rather than trying to force a design pattern into a framework.  I could also employ data oriented design strategies to gain additional performance in a project.  
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
    
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

There weren't too many new strategies I had to use on this scene.  As mentioned previously, most of my learning was from working inside a state machine.
        
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        
Iteration helped me build smaller units of functionality.  Each level of iteration led to more robust software and greater functionality in the program.
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    
At the start of the project, I built code that automated object creation and translation.  When the project requirements grew, and the original design could no longer fulfilled the projects requirements, I built code that generated appropriate .cpp files from the original data structures.  This allowed me to quickly prototype, then seamlessly move onto more complex code.
    
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computer graphics and visualization reemphasizes core computer science skills, like iterative development and efficient code design, that would aide me in any other computer science class.  It's also an exercise in applying the theoretical mathematical knowledge I gained in classes like linear algebra.  It's now clear how I can apply those skills I've gained in future programs I write.
        
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

The most obvious skill I gained from this is computer graphics itself;  I have a strong interest in graphics as a career field.  Outside of that, a great skill I gained from this course is recontextualizing problems.  One example is how I would have previously approached a problem like a fluid simulation.  I previously would have tried write a physics simulation of the waters surface, then generate geometry to match that surface. With some perspective, that simulation could be done through a texture or an animation.
